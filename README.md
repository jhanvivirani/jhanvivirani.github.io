## About Me
I'm an undergraduate student at the Honors College of Rutgers University- New Brunswick, where I study history, computer science, and political science.


## Things I Do
  - I work at the Infoseeking Lab at the Rutgers School of Communication and Information. I'm currently working on a project in collaboration called Armed Conflicts Analytics, which is a data visualization platform for the United Nations.
  - I write a column for the Daily Targum newspaper. My column, "From Breaks to Bar" analyzes hip-hop news and explores the nuances of hip-hop history and culture.
  - I am a research assistant at the Rutgers School of Management, where I help conduct research on disabilities in the workforce.
  - I am the Director of Internal Structures of the Rutgers Entrepreneurial Society, an on-campus student organization that connects students to opportunities in the start-up business field.
  - I tutor high school students for SAT and AP test preperation, and in subjects like math, chemistry, and history.
  - I like to knit, read, listen to music, write, and (when I have the time) binge-watch tv shows with my brother.
